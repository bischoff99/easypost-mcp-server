## Implementation Guides

### Integrating Qdrant into an LLM App (Shared Memory Example)
1. **Setup:** Install `pip install qdrant-client langchain`; run `docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant`.
2. **Code Example:**
   ```python
   from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
   from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

   client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
   store = Qdrant(client, "shared_memory", embeddings)

   # Store shared context
   store.add_texts(["Project notes..."], metadatas=[{"user": "team1"}])

   # Retrieve for LLM
   retriever = store.as_retriever(filter={"user": "team1"})
   docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("query")
   ```
3. **Best Practices:** Use metadata for multi-user access; enable replication for cross-sessions.

### Integrating SuperMemory
1. **Setup:** `pip install supermemory`; configure API.
2. **Code Example:**
   ```python
   from supermemory import MemoryStore

   store = MemoryStore(api_key="your_key")
   store.add("Context data", tags=["session1"])

   # Autonomous retrieval
   context = store.retrieve("relevant query")
   ```
3. **Best Practices:** Use for dynamic linking; combine with vector DBs.

### MCP Integration for Shared Memory
1. **Extend Server:** Add memory tools to your MCP (e.g., in src-tools-*.ts).
2. **Code Example:** Define a tool to query Qdrant via MCP.
3. **Best Practices:** Secure APIs; test cross-instance sharing.

## Comparative Analysis
- **For Collaborative/Shared Memory:** Qdrant excels in distributed setups; SuperMemory for autonomy.
- **Scalability vs. Ease:** ChromaDB for quick starts; Pinecone for scale.
- **Recommendations:** Start with ChromaDB for prototyping; scale to Qdrant for production shared memory.
