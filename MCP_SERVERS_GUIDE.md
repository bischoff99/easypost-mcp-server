## ⚠️ **Note on "Commander"**

I didn't see a specific "Commander" MCP server in Claude Desktop's config. The terminal/command execution might be:
- A feature within one of these servers
- Built into Claude Desktop directly (not via MCP)
- Or called something else

If you know the specific server name for command execution, let me know and I can add it!
